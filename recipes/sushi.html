	<p>Sushi is a Japanese dish consisting of rice that has been prepared with vinegar, sugar, and salt, and combined with a variety of ingredients such as seafood, vegetables, or even cooked meats. While often associated with raw fish, sushi encompasses a wide range of preparations, with the common element being the vinegared rice. </p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 ¼ cups Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
		<li>1 (4 inch) piece konbu dried kelp</li>
		<li>3 cups water</li>
		<li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
		<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Place rice into a large, deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns milky white. Pour off cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat 3 or 4 times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water.</li>
		<li>Drain rice in a fine strainer, then place into a saucepan along with konbu and 3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
		<li>Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard konbu. Stir in vinegar mixture until well incorporated and no lumps of rice remain. Allow to cool at room temperature. For a shinier appearance, use an electric fan to cool rice rapidly.</li>

	</ol>
